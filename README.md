# Nebbia
A very simple CSS system, used as a starting point in a few webapps of mine.

Colors and styles are inspired by the [catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

## Elements
Nebbia has basic typography, forms, button, navbar, a grid layout and an alternative title bar for blogs.
